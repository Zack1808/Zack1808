## Hi, I'm Jean-Pierre Novak

I'm a selftaught frontend developer with a lot of imagination. My journey started in 2018 in high school, where I was first introduced to the world of web development.
After graduating I've started learning new technologies and started improving my skills little by little.

Here is a list of skills I've gotten up to this point
- React.js
- CSS
- HTML
- Vue.js
- Bootstrap and other frameworks
- and, of course, git

I am currently a student at the Tehnical university of Zagreb, studying computer design.

This account containes some of the project that I've completed or that I am currently working on.
